Description : Check the direction of stack growth

Code snippet for checking whether a stack grows or shrinks in memory. 

Also we can see in this app that any static variable inside any funcs and global variables are residing in the lower memories alongside. Any parameters that are passed to funcs and local variables in the funcs are created inside the stack. The address of the funtion itself is also displayed, we expect it to be residing at a low memory location too.
